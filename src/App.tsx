        The purpose of this site is twofold.
        (1) I'm looking to build an archive of knowledge i and others can refer to. The archive should be trustworthy and prioritizes clarity and understanding.
        (2) I want to become a better engineer. Writing and research facilitates this. It's fun to get better at things.

        This is a work in progress. The layers will be modularized and will need constant updating, especially at higher levels of abstraction, where most people play.
